    <h1>Version Control System Project --- Cade Peppley, May 2019</h1>

    <div style="background-color: #018644; width: 400px;">
        <div style="width:300px; height:200px; margin-left: 50px;"><i>Version control systems are a category of software
                tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps
                track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers
                can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while
                minimizing disruption to all team members.</i></div>

        <div style="width:300px; height:275px; margin-left: 50px;"><i>By far, the most widely used modern version
                control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project
                originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.
                A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects
                as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of
                available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs
                (Integrated Development Environments).</i></div>
